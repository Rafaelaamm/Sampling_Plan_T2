# Sampling Plan based on Hotelling's T²

## Description

This Python code can be used to find the parameters for the repetitive sampling plan based on T² and also for the single sampling plan based on T².

## How to use

**Repetitive Sampling Plan based on T²**
*This program identifies the minimum mean sample size that meets the constraints (Alpha=0.05 and Beta=0.10) considering the input values, number and size of established iterations, for a given mean shift and p correlated variables.*

1. Enter the mean shift you want to detect and the number of correlated variables, using space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
2. Enter the initial values of N (sample size), KR (rejection constant) and KA (acceptance constant). Use space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
3. Enter the number of iterations and size of increment of N. Use space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
4. Enter the number of iterations and size of increment of KR. Use space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
5. Enter the number of iterations and size of increment of KA. Use space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
6. If there are any results that meet the restrictions, the program will display them. Otherwise, it will display the following sentence: No valid configuration found.

**Single Sampling Plan based on T²**
*This program identifies the minimum sample size that meets the constraints (Alpha=0.05 and Beta=0.10) considering the input values, number and size of established iterations, for a given mean shift and p correlated variables.*

2. Enter the initial values of N (sample size) and K (acceptance constant). Use space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
3. Enter the number of iterations and size of increment of N. Use space bar to separate them. After this press Enter keyboard.
4. Enter the number of iterations and size of increment of K. Use space bar to separate them. AAfter this press Enter keyboard.
5. If there are any results that meet the restrictions, the program will display them. Otherwise, it will display the following sentence: No valid configuration found.
